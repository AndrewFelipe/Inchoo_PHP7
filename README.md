# Inchoo_PHP7

PHP 7 compatibility extension for Magento 1 by Inchoo (http://inchoo.net/).

Tested on M CE 1.9.2.2. Older versions of Magento 1 may work, but may also have other problems, not fixed by this extension.

Backwards compatible. Tested by us on PHP 5.6 & 5.5. Users have reported it working fine even on 5.3.3. Installing the extension before switching to PHP 7 is a good idea.

Issues: yes. _(Of course.)_ See Issues tab. Issue reporting is welcome. Pull requests are welcome.
